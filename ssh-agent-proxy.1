.Dt SSH-AGENT-PROXY 1
.Os FreeBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm ssh-agent-proxy
.Nd a dynamic proxy for
.Xr ssh-agent 1
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cdkqrs
.Op Fl a Ar SOCK
.Op Fl p Ar FILE
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is a
.Sq dynamic
proxy for
.Xr ssh-agent 1 ,
which itself acts as an ssh authentication agent that forwards
requests to a real agent.  For each client request, it looks for a
.Sq real
agent by testing every available unix-domain socket that are
presumably opened by ssh-agent and owned by the running user.  If it
finds one, proxies client requests to the socket.
.Pp
This is especially useful when you use
.Xr screen 1
and agent forwarding.  Suppose you log in to a remote host with ssh
agent forwarding enabled, then run
.Xr screen 1 ,
and detach a session.  The
.Xr screen 1
process and all its child processes will now have a useless
.Ev SSH_AUTH_SOCK
value set.  If you reattach the saved session later from a new ssh
connection, agent forwarding will not work unless you fix the value
for the processes that run
.Xr ssh 1 .
.Pp
Here is what
.Nm
is for.  As the search for an available agent socket is dynamic and
the path of the socket that this command creates is fixed, there is no
need to worry about the
.Ev SSH_AUTH_SOCK
value any more.  You only need to have a fixed value set to
.Ev SSH_AUTH_SOCK ,
then agent forwarding will always work fine.
.Pp
Just as
.Xr ssh-agent 1
does,
.Cm
prints shell commands that can be evaluated in the calling shell to
set the
.Ev SSH_AUTH_SOCK
variable.  When
.Cm
finds an instance already running, it does not fork a new daemon but
prints shell commands anyway so that the running shell can use the
running instance.
.PP
.Nm
also tries running
.Xr launchctl 1
to get the socket opened by
.Xr launchd 8
via the
.Sq getenv
command if available.  This is for Mac OS X 10.5+ environment.
.Pp
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command line arguments are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact
.It Fl h
.It Fl -help
Show help and exit.
.Pp
.It Fl a Ar SOCK
Alter the proxy agent socket path. The default value is
.Pa /tmp/ssh%d/agent.sock ,
where the
.Cm %d
is replaced with the user ID.
.Pp
.It Fl c
Generate C-shell commands on stdout.  This is the default if
.Ev SHELL
looks like it's a csh style of shell.
.Pp
.It Fl d
Turn on debug mode.  When this option is specified,
.Nm
will not go background.
.Pp
.It Fl k
Kill the proxy agent according to the process ID recorded in the pid
file.
.Pp
.It Fl p Ar FILE
Alter the pid file path.  The default value is
.Pa /tmp/ssh%d/agent.pid ,
where the
.Cm %d
is replaced with the user ID.
.Pp
.It Fl q
Supress informational messages.
.Pp
.It Fl r
Kill the proxy agent if one is already running and restart a new one.
.Pp
.It Fl s
Generate Bourne shell commands on stdout.  This is the default if
.Ev SHELL
does not look like it's a csh style of shell.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/tmp/ssh%d/agent.sock"
.It Pa /tmp/ssh%d/agent.pid
Default location of the pid file.
.Pp
.It Pa /tmp/ssh%d/agent.sock
Default location of the proxy agent socket.
.Pp
.It Pa /tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXXXX/agent.<ppid>
Candidates for agent sockets to try.
.Pp
.It Pa /tmp/<pid>/SSHKeychain.socket
A candidate for agent sockets to try.  This is for SSHKeychain on Mac
OS X.
